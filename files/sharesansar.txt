Investors' group are forewarning that the broker's license suspension would result in them protesting on the streets. Here is what they have said-

On behalf of 54 lakh investors, we would like to draw the attention of all concerned that all the steps being taken by the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), Securities Board of Nepse (SEBON), and other agencies of the Government of Nepal in accordance with our agreement with the investors and our demand to organize the capital market of Nepal through correct policy rules, cutting-edge technology, infrastructure, and strict regulation, will be hampered if some self-serving groups put obstacles in their way and stop them.

The Nepalese capital market violates the constitution and anti-government laws because it is prohibited from modernization and is kept under the control of a small number of people or groups. We warn the relevant stakeholders that Nepal's capital market will suffer a huge loss and will be pushed back for years.

The 58-point recommendations and 19-point agreement should be immediately and fully implemented without creating any obstacles or opposition, the investment of ordinary investors should be protected, the backbone of the country's economy should be strengthened, and the investment environment should be prepared. The government and associated entities are hereby urged to comply. If it is not complied than we will be protesting on the streets.
